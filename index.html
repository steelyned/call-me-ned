               and customers is paramount to sustaining a seamless flow of 
               materials or inputs that fulfill the manufacturing needs.

              prompt information and replenishment of critical spare parts 
              are crucial to maintain an uninterrupted supply chain.

              To meet these demands, we leverage the power of Relational 
              Database Management System (RDBMS) and web development technologies. 
              This enables us to create a comprehensive and user-friendly 
              web platform that assures customers of their needs. 
              By implementing an RDBMS, we ensure that all critical 
              information is stored and managed efficiently, enabling 
              quick retrieval and analysis.

        <h2>Quality Management Systems (QMS) Practitioner | Consultant | Web Developer</h2>
        <p>My journey as a QMS practitioner began in the late 1990s, where I 
          had the opportunity to manage, control, and guide our organization 
          in designing, developing, and implementing its QMS. In my role as 
          Management Representative (MR), Internal Auditor, and Documentation 
          Specialist, I have worn many hats and gained extensive experience 
          in various areas, including Training, Customer Relationship Management, 
          Business Development, Human Resources Management, Quality Assurance, 
          Web Development & Information Technology, and Design and Development.</p>

          <p>As a consultant, I have also had the privilege of guiding and 
            developing two other companies in their quest for ISO 9001 QMS 
            certification. Throughout the years, I have been committed to 
            delivering high-quality services and ensuring customer satisfaction 
            by putting their needs at the forefront of all operations.</p>
          
          <p>I retired in mid-2018 and 
            decided to explore new opportunities. I found myself teaching 
            English to Chinese students of various ages, which has been a 
            fulfilling and rewarding experience. I have developed a strong 
            bond with my students and their mothers, learning Mandarin to 
            better communicate with them. In recognition of my efforts, 
            I was awarded the Best 5-star teacher for the years 2020 and 2021. 
            I have successfully passed the TESOL certification.</p>
          
          <p>Although my career has taken a different direction, my previous 
            experience in QMS has given me valuable skills and insights that 
            I continue to apply to my teaching profession.
